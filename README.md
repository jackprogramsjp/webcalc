## What is webcalc?

Webcalc stands for Website Calculator. Webcalc is a localhost/website that's just like a calculator, except the calculator is written in Golang instead of JavaScript.

## Why use webcalc?

I was bored, and I didn't know what to make so I thought of something random that had to do with websites.

# Building

You can build the source with shell. But, you must have golang installed in your system, and you must have shell. This project used `go 1.16`.

After you execute `build.sh`, it may take a minute or more to build all the binaries.
